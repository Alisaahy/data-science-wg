# General Guidelines

Ideally, a DSWG Project:
- has a community or government partner within a few weeks
- has a team lead (or several)
- has a presence on github, slack, and the website
- is working towards answering a question that can be summarized as some sort of deliverable, eg:
    - a workbook
    - a report
    - a presentation
    - a website
    - a blog posting


## Github

- Setup a github repo on sfbrigade's github with the form `github.com/sfbrigade/datasci-{projectname}`
- create a `README.md` file using the template in this repo [README-template.md](https://github.com/sfbrigade/data-science-wg/blob/master/dswg_project_resources/Project-README-template.md)
- Create a Pull Request Template using the template in this repo [PULL_REQUEST_TEMPLATE.md](../PULL_REQUEST_TEMPLATE.md)
- the most important features here are "current needs" and "contact" so that new members can learn more


## Slack

- create a slack channel of the form `#datasci-{projectname}`
- in the "About" section, set the channel's purpose and include a link to the project's Github page

## Webpage
