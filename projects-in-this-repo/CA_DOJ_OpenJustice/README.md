## CA Dept. of Justice OpenJustice Project
### Modeling & Hypothesis Testing

Below, members of the Data Science Working Group have been charged with answering, via inferential statistics, some of the California Department of Justice's inquiries, inspired by their early exploratory analyses at [OpenJustice.org](http://wwww.openjustice.org).  

Responsible DSWG Members:
+ Catherine Zhang
+ Sushma Y.
+ Peter James
+ Jude Calvillo

#### Status, as of June 4, 2016:

+ Need drawn from -and verified by- CA DOJ's Chief Data Scientist
+ Getting and cleaning data (some external data needed)
+ Divving up responsibilities between teammates

#### The Prompts

1. Which counties/agencies arrest African American juveniles at a statistically significantly higher rate than that of other counties/agencies?
    - Expanding analysis to each ethnicity
    - Drilling down to felonies vs. misdemeanors

2. Statewide, what contextual and ethnic factors best predict the arrest of juveniles for felonies?

3. Statewide, what contextual and ethnic factors best predict the arrest of juveniles for battery, specifically?

4. For resource allocation prompt: ~. predictors to crime rate (i.e. not necessarily optimization; just a first, exploratory step)
